## How to play

To play the game, you simply have to visit the link mentioned on the right side of the page and the game should load in your web browser. Game should work flawlessly on almost all of the modern web browser. If any problem is encountered, please use the issues tab to create a 'issue' and the developer will respond within 24-48 hrs.

You can use arrow keys to navigate the ship and find your way through the map, reaching the goal within time limit.

### Note

At any point of time, if you get Stuck, press the **Right-Shift** key and a map menu will open using which you can localize yourself in the game world and navigate till the finish line.

A **Mini-map** feature of the game will be developed some time later. Unfortunately, at this point of time, it is not available to the users and hence user must use the Right-shift key to localize himself. Any inconvenience is deeply regretted.
